# New-Pack
Python Bedrock scripting pack generator.
Useful for when you are lazy to make a manifest for scripting.
Especially since it changes each and every update.
This was a fun little project that I made late night instead of sleeping.
So I'm sure it can be improved or has bugs.

# How to Use?
It's simple really, just run the `.exe` that is off to the right in releases.
It should open a window, when it does, input your pack name, folder name, description, file entry, and a path to where you want to make it.
You have a couple options you can use, such as, which modules you want, and what version you want.

# Contributions
Anyone can fork and build on to this along with making pull requests. The best was to contribute is to just open issues when there is something wrong or if you think I should add something to improve this program.

# Credits
All coding credit goes to me `MisledWater79` at the moment but some credit goes to `mrpatches123` for inspiring me to make something better than his weird node version of basically this.
